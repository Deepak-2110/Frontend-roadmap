# Frontend-roadmap
This is a simple web design of frontend roadmap which i have created by using html  and basic CSS 

This is a simple web project that I created to design a pamphlet‑style roadmap using HTML and a bit of CSS.

✏️ What I used
HTML tags:

<p> for paragraphs

<a> with href for links

<br> for line breaks

<b> and <i> for bold and italic text

<img> to display images

CSS:

Basic text styling (like colors, fonts, or alignment)

Image width adjustments to fit the layout

📌 Purpose
The goal of this project is to practice structuring and styling a simple roadmap or informational pamphlet that combines text and images.
It can be viewed in a web browser as a single scrolling page.
